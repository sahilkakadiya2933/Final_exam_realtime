# Add the names of the binaries you want to add a symbols to the target
# to debug through valgrind.
#
# e.g sbin/devb-ram
#
# Binaries that should be picked up from SDP/target_symbols should be
# suffixed with .sym else the stage or normal SDP binary will be picked up
#
# e.g. sbin/devb-ram.sym
#
# Note: libc and ldqnx are added automatically.
