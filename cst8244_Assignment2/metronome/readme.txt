Title: Assignment #2 – Metronome Resource Manager

Name: Sahil Kakadiya and Meet Kotadiya

Sahil Kakadiya : I led the project’s initial configuration and setup, focusing on implementing the io_read function to monitor metronome status and assist with information retrieval. My major contribution involved refining the metronome_thread function, where I concentrated on optimizing timing accuracy and managing metronome pulse execution.

Meet Kotadiya : I developed the io_write function to handle a range of commands, including pause, quit, start, set, and stop. I also designed the io_open function to facilitate the connection to the resource manager, ensuring efficient pulse transmission. My efforts included integrating the resource manager with the broader system, guaranteeing cohesive operation across all system components.
